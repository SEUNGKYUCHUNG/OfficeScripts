## Description
This Office Script automatically creates tables for you. 


I have created an Office Script that automatically creates a table. If you are like me and have to create lengthy excel reports frequently, this may be for you. 

Here is the basic instructions on setting up AutoTable:
1. Open any workbook in Excel for Windows or for Mac and select the Automate tab.
2. Click on New Script.
3. On the left side, you will see the Code Editor pop up, click on Script 6 or whatever number populates, and rename the file.
